 * \brief The function to solve a solution path recursively

The function checks if the current path leads to a complete solution path. It returns 0 if a solution path is found; otherwise it extends the current path to its neighbor (strictly following this order: left, right, up, down) and recursively calls solvePath to find a solution path.  If no solution path is found, it returns 1.

The function generates the start and target positions, and the maze's walls using C pseudorandom number initialized by the input seed. The wall generation is determined by the input threshold.
